## üí° There's so much more that can be done. SO if you want to expand on this further, you can try this out.

-   Filtering by generation
-   Abilities and move data
-   Caching layers for performance
-   Similar Pokemon Logic -> Take multiple Props into consideration and calculate similarity
-   Berries / Machines / Compatibilty
-   Rate Pokemon or favourite Pokemons
-   CRON Jobs to add any new pokemon added to the pokeapi db.
-   Most of the caching is done via prefetching in this project. You can optimize by introducing robust caching on the Laravel backend (Redis, response caching, etc.).
